# CubingBuddy

Track Rubik's cube solves, set up practice sessions, and look at trends. After each time the timer is used or a time is manually inputted, a new scramble for cube will be generated. WCA scrambles can be generated for 3x3, pyraminx, skewb, 2x2, 4x4, and 5x5. For customizable practice sessions, set a goal. Goals can be a number of solves, a number of sets of solves, or a number of solves separated by forced "rest" time. In the bottom right corner, your cubing buddy will cheer you on and celebrate new milestones in your cubing journey!
